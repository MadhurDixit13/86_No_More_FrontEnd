# Test Cases for Frontend APIs

In this project, we have employed the Enzyme and jest Framework to comprehensively test the functionality of our frontend APIs. 

## How to run test cases

### 1. Run the following command to run all the test cases written. 

```
npm test
```

### 2. To see the analytics, 

1. Check if your package.json contains the required dependency. If not then run the following code and install it. This code is used to install the enzyme library

```
npm install enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer - - save-dev --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. The jest-enzyme installation required is done by the code
3. 
```
npm install jest-enzyme --save-dev --legacy-peer-dep
```

3. Then installation of enzyme adapter is done by the code
   
```
npm install @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17 --save-dev â€“legacy-peer-dep
```

4. The complete test suite run will be shown as this

These tests serve as a critical component in ensuring the robustness and reliability of our frontend services, guaranteeing that they meet the specified requirements and perform as expected.
