### &nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements in Project 3

In this update, we've addressed and resolved several issues while introducing significant improvements to our application. The menu page now boasts a refined interface with categorized food items, resolving formatting glitches along the way. The Order page has undergone a facelift for a more organized layout, displaying the cost of orders both in the database and on the front end. Our Inventory list has been fine-tuned for better aesthetics and functionality. The homepage has been transformed with a cleaner design, removing unnecessary elements and introducing an engaging image. Notably, we've integrated QR codes for streamlined PayPal payments, complemented by a clickable link for added convenience. These changes collectively aim to elevate the user experience,
